As an amateur radio operator I need to be aware of several different coordinate systems.

As a C# developer I want to explore coordinate systems and conversions in code.

The goal of this project is to explore coordinate systems, conversions between them, and software dev lifecycle processes.

The initial idea for this project came for a QST magazine article titled "Conversion Between Geodetic and Grid Locator Systems" by Edmund T. Tyson, N5JTY. [QST January 1989, pp. 29-30, 43]


** NOTE **
Access to QST Magazine and its articles might be restricted to ARRL Members only.
I am a current ARRL Member, and an active member of the amateur community.
